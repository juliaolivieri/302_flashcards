 302_flashcards

 NOTE: anki_4 is the most recent (includes all cards)

Throughout the summer I've been trying to make flashcards of problems we go
over in study group, and problems from various quals.  This is through the
program Anki, which you can download for free here: 
https://apps.ankiweb.net/.  

I've tried to tag cards from quals with their year and season.

If you just want to browse the questions and answers, I suggest clicking on the
"browse" button on top of the home screen (other options are Decks and Add).
Then make sure you select the 302 deck in the sidebar, and there should be the
options of all the cards on the screen.  When one is selected, it'll show the
latexed versions of the question and answer.  Click the "preview" button in the
top right-hand corner, and it'll show the formatted version of the card.  Click
the "<" button on the bottom of the preview screen to get the answer.

I don't promise that all the answers are right; in fact, sometimes I just write
in the card that I don't know how to finish a problem.  If anyone wants to
provide guidance for these, I'm happy to get it.  

Thanks to Allison's handwritten qual answers, as well as study group and online
answers.  I plan on adding to this over the next few days.
